What's New in PyQ 4.1
*********************

:Release: 4.1

   import numpy

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

  * Improved calling Python functions from q.
    - Objects of any type supported by K() can be returned.
    - Python functions can be called from multiple q threads.
  * Calls from Python to q will now release GIL allowing concurrent
    execution of q code from multiple threads.
  * Added a backtrace mode (requires kdb+ 3.5 or later) in which q
    stack trace is printed on q errors.
  * Experimental Windows support.
  * Performance improvements.


Return arbitrary objects from Python functions called from q
============================================================

When a Python function is called from q, the returned Python
objects are now automatically converted to q.  Any type accepted
by the K() constructor can be successfully converted.  For example,
the ``numpy.eye`` function returns a 2-D array with ones on the
diagonal and zeros elsewhere.  It can be called from q as follows:

::

    q)p)import numpy
    q)p)q.eye = numpy.eye
    q)eye 3 4 1
    0 1 0 0
    0 0 1 0
    0 0 0 1


Calling Python from ``peach``
=============================

Python functions can now be safely called from multiple q threads.
For example, the following session illustrates how ``peach`` distributes
work between four threads:

::

    $ q -s 4
    q)p)import threading
    q)p)q.tid = threading.get_ident
    q){group (distinct x)?x} {tid()} peach til 19
    0| 0 4 8 12 16
    1| 1 5 9 13 17
    2| 2 6 10 14 18
    3| 3 7 11 15


Backtrace mode
==============

.. note::

    Backtrace mode is available when PyQ is running under kdb+ version 3.5
    or later.

To activate the backtrace mode, set the environment variable ``PYQ_BACKTRACE``.

For example::

    $ PYQ_BACKTRACE=yes pyq
    >>> q('f:{g[]};g:{1+`};f[]')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ..
    _k.error: ('type', k('((({1+`};2);("..g";"";-1;"{1+`}");2;5);(({g[]};2);("..f";"";-1;"{g[]}");1;4);..'))
    kdb+ backtrace:
      [5]  g:{1+`}
               ^
      [4]  f:{g[]}
              ^
      [3]  f:{g[]};g:{1+`};f[]
                           ^
      ..


Experimental Windows support
============================

PyQ can now be installed on Windows.  We tested PyQ 4.1.0 with Python 3.6 build using VS 2015 and 2017
and 32-bit kdb+ 3.5.

PyQ 4.1.1 adds support for Python 2.7.x with `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 <http://aka.ms/vcpython27>`_.

Latest updates on Windows support, as well as latest patches can be found at `Github <https://github.com/enlnt/pyq/issues/1>`_.
